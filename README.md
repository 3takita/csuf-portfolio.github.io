This is my personal portfolio, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is foundational, so I intend to keep building on it. 

The portfolio is simple and easy to navigate. The landing page is the "Home" page. The navigation buttons at the top enable you to go from one page to another. Other pages on the portfolio are "About" page, "Portfolio" page, "Skills" page, and "Contact" page.
